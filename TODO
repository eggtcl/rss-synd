0.7 - Allow custom headers to be set for feeds (some feeds need cookie auth)
0.7 - Devise a better way of parsing feeds based on the total number of feeds used.
0.7 - Replace \n with \s BEFORE announcement.
0.7 - Update feeds on !trigger.
0.7 - Article filtering, If the title doesn't match, don't announce it.
0.7 - Add a parser timeout to break out of a loop if the feed is improperly 
      formatted and is looping the timer. Test with html4 pages. The parser
      could also be improved to handle this.

	  
0.? - Auto select the encoding based on the xml header. If the xml header can't be read, try again with utf-16.
	  This requires a map of the xml encoding names and tcl encodings
