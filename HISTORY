0.6 (2012-02-27)
* Added support for feedencoding to read feeds with any encoding.

0.5 (2011-01-05)
* HM2K joined the project
* Split license from rss-synd.tcl into LICENSE file
* Introduced new Tcl file headers to rss-synd.tcl
* Split settings from rss-synd.tcl into rss-synd-settings.tcl
* Split TODO list from HISTORY into new TODO file
* Reformatted HISTORY file
* Reformatted README file

0.5b2 (2010-04-14)
* Call ::http::cleanup event when an error occurs in
  ::rss-synd::feed_callback.
* Fixed an error where self closing child elements with the same tag name
  as their parents were not being parsed as intended.
* Fixed issue #1 where a regular expression was incorrectly matching tag
  names that started with the whole name of the tag we were looking for.
* Added a more detailed error message if the ::http::status is "error".

0.5b1 (2007-12-17)
* Optimised and cleaned up some code. The parser is now 6-8% faster now on
  my box.
* Fixed possible infinite loop in the xml parser.
* Somewhat fixed "charset" setting, should now work in most cases. If it
  doesn't work correctly try it without "charset".
* Changed PUB and MSG trigger procs to be the same.

0.4 (2007-02-08)
* Fixed for feeds using ' for attributes instead of ".
* Fixed for feeds using the <!DOCTYPE> tag.
* Fixed $state(url) bug (thanks alky).

0.3 (2006-11-27)
* Added a new XML parser. should be significantly faster and more accurate.
  - The XML data is now structured internally, for quick & easy access.
  - CDATA is now handled correctly.
* Added support for HTTPS. Requires: TLS package, http://www.sensus.org/tcl/
* Added support for basic HTTP authorisation. Requires: base64 package from
  tcllib, http://tcllib.sourceforge.net/
* Added support for compressed (gzipped) feeds. Requires: Trf package,
  http://tcltrf.sourceforge.net/
* Added public & private triggers.
* Added multi-lined output, just use \n.
* Added decoding of hexadecimal HTML elements.
* Fixed trigger announcing updates to all channels, rather than just the one
  it was triggered from.
* Fixed pub_trigger proc which wrongly matched text containing wildcards with
  triggers.
* Fixed double encoded elements, for example: &amp;amp; will now be properly
  decoded.
* Changed the default order of output when more than one new item is to be
  announced, now the newest items are last. This is configurable with the
  'output-order' setting.
* Changed some error messages to be more meaningful.
* Changed the cookie format (again). to get the attribute of a tag you must
  do: @@tag!=attribute@@.
* Changed some proc's, moved some code and cleaned up a few variable names.
* Changed how it determines if the story is new. Rather than just checking
  against the last entry it will scan all articles in the database to
  see if it already exists. This should fix problems with spamming old
  articles (eg: when articles were buried on digg).
* Changes the decoding of decimal HTML element to be less strict.
* Much more...

0.2 (2005-09-21)
* Fixed problem with feeds using 'special' characters and enabling the
  'eval-tcl' option.
* Fixed problem with hanging on self closing tags.
* Fixed <CDATA> support.
* Fixed error with invalid html entities within feed data.
* Fixed problem with PRIVMSG having to many targets
* Fixed some other little problems
* Added stripping of unwanted HTML from feeds.
* Added support for output of any entity or value within <item> and <channel>.
  eg: for '<item><song size="1010101">Example</song></item>' you could use
  @@item!=song!size@@ or @@item!song!name@@.
* Changed cookie divider from : to !.
* Changed default timeout to 60 seconds

0.1 (2005-08-23)
* Initial release
